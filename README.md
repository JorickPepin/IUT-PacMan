# IUT-Pacman

Pac-Man game in Java.

## Context

This is a second semester project. Its objective is to create a game from a small game framework and its design. Only the code is available here.

## Main tools used

* ``.map`` file to recreate the map by reading it in the program
* graph and Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm

## Limits 

The missing elements compared to the original game are : 

* personalized ghost movements (here, they move randomly while they all have a different way of moving in the original game)
* levels and fruit
